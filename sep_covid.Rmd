<p><b>COVID-19 (Coronavirus) has affected day to day life and is slowing down the global economy. This
pandemic has affected thousands of peoples, who are either sick or are being killed due to the spread of
this disease. The most common symptoms of this viral infection are fever, cold, cough, bone pain and
breathing problems, and ultimately leading to pneumonia. This, being a new viral disease affecting humans
for the first time, vaccines are not yet available. From shifting to online mode of communication and travel
restrictions to deterioration in mental health and increase in substance abuses. COVID-19 has presented
itself with new challenges and through this report we will assess the socio-economic impact based on data
from the Associate Press for the period between April-June 2020.</b>

<h1>Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health</h1>
<p> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety about a new disease and what could happen can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. </p>

<p>Public health actions, such as social distancing, can make people feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. However, these actions are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19. To study the mental health impact of COVID-19, a population count of 101076 were surveyed for any mental health concerns like depression. </p>

<h1>Economical Impact of COVID-19</h1>
<p>
The COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on the economical conditions of the population. The reduction of business due to restrictions and change in the trade system has resulted in loss of jobs or other sources of incomes, which resulted in economic hardships. As a result, people reached out various government and non-government bodies for financial, social and lifestyle assistance.</p> 

<p>In the below graph, a population group of 202152 were studied. </p>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>We can observe that majority of the people did not receive nor applied for any economical assistance, which is aprx. 86% of the studied population. </li>
<li>9% of the population studied did receive assistance, i.e. 18401 people </li>
</ul>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<br>
</br>
<ul>
<li>Through the Social impact section, we observed that there is a significant increase in  the frequency of social interaction among friends and families during covid19. We can conclude that, people preferred to stay connected with their loved ones during this difficult time. </li>
<li>Before the COVID-19 outbreak, majority of the population chose their physical health as  "very good" and "excellent" and only few people chose "poor". However post covid 12% responded "Yes" to any physical impact of COVID-19</li> 
<li> Through the Mental Health section, we observed that people have more social reaction of mental health issues, as compared to physical reactions. People who have felt mental heath issues and symptoms, have observed 10.3% more social reactions  as compared to physical reactions </li>
<li>Daily life routine was deeply impacted but people are adapting to the new normal</li>
<li>part ofpopulation were economically affected and apllied for Fiancial & Lifestyle assistance from Govt. & Non-govt. bodies</li>A
